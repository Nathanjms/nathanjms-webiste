                                                My dissertation involved developing a computational Mathematical model to investigate chemokine gradient development in interstitial tissues.
                                                I focused on three main biological factors (CCL21 binding/unbinding, diffusion of CCL21, and dendritic cell cleaving) and converted them into Mathematical models.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                My dissertation enabled me to combine my interest in both programming and Maths to come up with a suitable model that conclusions
                                                could be drawn from.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                I used the programming language MATLAB to simulate the model computationally and to produce a time-dependent animation and results. Despite the
                                                simplifications made throughout the model building process, there was reasonably good agreement with experimental data.

                                        My third year project was a lot more Mathematical than my dissertation. It involved developing the Theory of Geometrical Diffraction from the wave equation,
                                        and then applying it to the scattering of waves in a parabola, as well as a circle.
